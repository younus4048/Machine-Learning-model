Machine Learning Model Implementation
Description:
This project implements a machine learning model using [insert model/algorithm name here, e.g., Naive Bayes, Random Forest, etc.] to solve [brief description of problem, e.g., classification, regression]. 
The model is trained on a dataset and evaluated based on performance metrics.

Features
Data Preprocessing: [Mention data cleaning steps, e.g., handling missing values, encoding, etc.]
Model Training: Trains a [model name] model on the processed data.
Evaluation: Provides model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.)

How to Run
python task4.py
